# Adventure

Welcome to Adventure! For this project, you will add different
item types to a text adventure using OOP principles. Use the test specs to guide
you as you work through each task described below.

## Setup and Running the code

1. Clone the project from the starter.
2. Type `node game.js` to run the project
3. Type `npm install` to install the tests
4. Type `npm test` to run the tests

## Tips on how to work thrugh this practice

This practice starter includes a (slightly incomplete) command line game that
you play by interacting with prompts in the terminal. First, run the game with
the command `node game.js`, explore the commands available, and play the game to
see how it works.

The commands are:

```shell
Controls:
  Type 'h' for help
  Type 'q' to quit
  Type 'l' to look around
  Type 'i' to check your inventory
  Type 'take <item>' to take an item
```
